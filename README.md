# Discord-channel-scraper
uh, if you want images and gifs or videos from a discord channel, I guess u could use this ?

Just copy ur discord token and the ChannelID you want the images from and yeah thats it. This readme was really needed

oh yeah and pip3 install requests

if u dont already have that...

and no u can not get the whole channels media. Only up to 50 pages or whatever
